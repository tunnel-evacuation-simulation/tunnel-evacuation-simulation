# TODO

<hr>

[x] Base search algorithm on an **a\*** \
[x] Move initialization logic in `src/game.py` to a standalone function \
[x] Get rid of `TITLE` and `TILE_SIZE` parameters from `src/settings.py` and replace them with properties from `src/simulations/example_simulation.json` (file should be read on the start of the simulation - read above) \
[ ] Make logging possible - define directory `src/output_files/` in which the output simulation data (like time etc.) will be stored \
[ ] Define some better colours \
[ ] Experiment with simulation parameters \
[ ] Document the code in a pythonic way (write [docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for each class) \
[ ] Write tests for some simple cases (like wrong input file etc.) \
